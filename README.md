Doge Adventure!
===============

Doge Adventure! is a text adventure game inspired by
[leonsumbitches](http://dailydoge.tumblr.com/post/21839788086/leonsumbitches-you-have-encountered-a-doge)
written in [dogescript](https://github.com/remixz/dogescript).

My [dogescript fork](https://github.com/ngscheurich/dogescript) was used for this project and includes support else/else if statements. Use it if you want. Whatever.
